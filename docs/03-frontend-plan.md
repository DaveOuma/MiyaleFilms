# Frontend Plan (Next.js + Tailwind)

## Pages (initial)
- Home: featured work + category entry points + contact call-to-action
- Portfolio Category: grid of event covers, filterable by category
- Event Story: hero image/video + curated gallery + details + enquiry CTA
- Contact: form + WhatsApp link

## UI Principles
- Visual-first layout
- Fast loading (optimised images, lazy loading)
- Minimal text (short, confidence-building copy)
- Mobile-first (many clients come from WhatsApp and Instagram)

## Data Fetching
- Frontend consumes the Django REST API
- Initial approach: server components or fetch in page layer
