# Project Scope

## Problem
Event clients want to quickly see relevant work (weddings, birthdays, political/public events) and contact the creator for bookings.

## Goal
Build a fast, visual-first portfolio that:
- showcases curated event galleries and highlight reels
- supports “Event Stories” pages (one event per page)
- includes clear calls to action (WhatsApp / contact form)
- is easy to update via an admin interface

## Non-goals (for the first version)
- Payments and e-commerce
- Client login area
- Full booking calendar integration

## Target Users
- Potential clients (couples, families, event organisers)
- Agencies/PR teams for political/public events
- Collaborators (videographers, photographers, editors)
